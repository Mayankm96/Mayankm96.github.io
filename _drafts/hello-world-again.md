description: Opinion on how the four years have shaped my life
---

With the position of a teaching assistant in a course and working on a few projects that I wanted to wrap up before graduating along with managing my coursework, last semester was quite a hectic experience! But now that it is over, I believe it has been the best of all. Of course I regret a bit to not spend enough time with my friends for that one 'last' time before graduation, but I am grateful to them to understand my situation and putting up with me.

Thinking about it now the last four years at college has helped me change a lot. I ended up meeting some of the coolest people here without whom I feel my life would have been really incomplete. For the most part, I might not want to change anything that has happened in the last four years.
