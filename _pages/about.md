I will be starting my Masters programme on Robotics, Systems and Controls at [ETH Zurich](http://www.master-robotics.ethz.ch/) in fall 2018. My research interests lie in designing end-to-end systems for navigation and manipulation in unknown environments.

I graduated from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) in May 2018 with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering.  During my undergraduate programme, I worked on the designing and development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and founded the [AUV team](https://auviitk.com) at IIT Kanpur. In the summers of 2017, I worked with [Prof. Wolfram Burgard](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~burgard/) on landing sites detection from aerial images.

Apart from my academic engagements, I enjoy playing lawn tennis and was a part of [IIT Kanpur's tennis team](http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/lawn-tennis). In my spare time, I love tinkering around with new hardware and designing new things especially robots.
