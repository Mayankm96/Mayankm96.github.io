I am a graduate student in Robotics, Systems and Controls program at [ETH Zurich](http://www.master-robotics.ethz.ch/). My research interests lie in designing learning-based systems for navigation and manipulation in unknown environments.

I graduated from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) in May 2018 with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. In the summer of 2017, I worked with [Prof. Wolfram Burgard](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~burgard/) on predicting landing sites from aerial images. During my undergraduate program, I co-founded the [AUV team](https://auviitk.com) for marine robotics and worked on various mecahnical, electrical and software aspects of the project.

Apart from my academic engagements, I enjoy playing lawn tennis, swimming and trying out new cuisines! In my spare time, I often end up procrastinating on GitHub or reading about new hardware.
