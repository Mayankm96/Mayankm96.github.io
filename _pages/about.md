I am a fourth year undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering at [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), India. My research interests lie in Robotics, Controls and Machine Learning.

In the summers of 2017, I was a research intern with [Prof. Dr. Wolfram Burgard](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~burgard/) at University of Freiburg, Germany.

Prior to this, I was working as an undergraduate researcher with [Prof. Shantanu Bhattacharya](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~bhattacs/) in Boeing's University Relations Program at IIT Kanpur, [*Abhyast*](http://www.iitk.ac.in/dord/boeing/public/).

Apart from my academic engagements, I enjoy playing lawn tennis and was a part of [IIT Kanpur's tennis team](http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/lawn-tennis). In my spare time, I love tinkering around with new hardware and designing new things especially robots.
