The following presentations are based some of the research papers I covered in various reading groups.

* Kinematic Planning for Mobile Manipulators using Optimal Control ([slides](/assets/documents/talks/kinematic-planning-for-mobile-manipulators.pdf))
    * Efficient kinematic planning for mobile manipulators with non-holonomic constraints using optimal control, Giftthaler _et al._ (2017)

* Maximum-a-Posteriori Policy Optimization ([slides](/assets/documents/talks/map-policy-optimization.pdf))
    * MAP Policy Optimization, Abdolmaleki _et al._ (2018)
    * V-MPO: On-Policy MAP Policy Optimization For Discrete and Continuous Control, Song _et al._ (2019)

* Meta-Learning with Implicit Gradients ([slides](/assets/documents/talks/meta-learning-with-implicit-gradients.pdf))
    * Meta-Learning with Implicit Gradients, Rajeswaran _et al._ (2019)

* Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning ([slides](/assets/documents/talks/hierarchical_rl.pdf))
    * FeUdal Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Vezhnevets _et al._ (2017)
    * Data-Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Nachum _et al._ (2018)
    * Meta Learning Shared Hierarchies, Frans _et al._ (2017)


As a part of the [Robotics Club](https://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/) at IIT Kanpur, I gave these presentations to share knowledge about robotics with the campus community:

* (Summer 2018): Introduction to Robot Operating System ([slides](/assets/documents/talks/Intro_to_ROS.pdf), [tutorial](/assets/documents/talks/Tutorial-ROS.pdf), [post](/blog/2017/ros-tips/))
* (Fall 2016): Sensors and Actuators ([slides](/assets/documents/talks/sensors-and-actuators.pdf))
* (Fall 2016): Introduction to Robotics ([slides](/assets/documents/talks/intro-to-robotics.pdf))

## teaching


* (Winter 2017: TA, guest lecturer): [AE640A: Autonomous Navigation](https://ae640a.github.io) with [Mangal Kothari](https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/mangal/)

    * preparing course materials and assignments
    * guest lecturer on system integration using ROS ([slides](/assets/documents/teaching/ae640a/ae640a_lecture1.pdf)), robot simulation using Gazebo ([slides](/assets/documents/teaching/ae640a/ae640a_lecture2.pdf)), mathematical foundation for Robotics ([slides](/assets/documents/teaching/ae640a/ae640a_lecture9.pdf)), and non-parametric filters for localization
