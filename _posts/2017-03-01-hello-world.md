It has been a while since I have thought of writing a blog. The motivation first came when my friends and I were thinking of starting a blog for a [project](http://auviitk.com) to keep track of our progress. My friend [Shikher](http://shikherverma.com), a great developer, helped me with the initial push that I desperately needed to start things off.

Since I stay occupied with my projects and academics, I hope to blog semi- regularly. A few of these blogs might be blatant venting and sharing of my experiences, while others would be on observations that I, as a robotics enthusiast, would like to share with others. 

Robotics, an inter- disiplinary field as one may know, requires knowledge from a variety of majors. This persuaded me take several electives from other departments during my undergrad, providing me a flavour of the kind of research prospects the field holds. 

 When I first started with robotics in high school, I was using the kit called [Lego Mindsotrm NXT 1.0](https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms). At that time, building and programming a robot seemed like an intuitive and creative task to me. However, as I started looking into robotics from an engineer's perspective, the intuition began being backed up with concrete math and physics. This very connection between intution and knowledge is what made me want to persue a career in STEM.

 Now as the semesters are passing by in college, each abstracted layer in that Lego kit is being stripped down to its fundamentals, bringing in new and mature ideas to design real- world systems.
