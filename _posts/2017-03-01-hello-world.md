It has been a while since I have thought of writing a blog. The motivation first came to me when my firnds and I were discussing about to start a blogging section on a [project](http://auviitk.com) that we were working on. My friend [Shikher](http://shikherverma.com), a great developer, helped me out in setting the initial stages for this website, especially the initial push that I desperately needed.

Since I tend to be occupied with my projects and academics, I hope to blog semi- regularly. A few of the blogs might be blatant venting and sharing of my experiences, while others would be on things that a robotics enthusiast might be interested to know. Robotics, being an inter- disiplinary field, requires knowledge from a variety of majors. This made me take several electives from other majors during my undergrad, something not typically seen where I come from.
