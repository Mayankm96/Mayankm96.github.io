The work done is a part of ['FOUNT2: Flying localization system for rescuing and recovering victims'](https://www.sifo.de/de/fount2-fliegendes-lokalisierungssystem-fuer-die-rettung-und-bergung-von-verschuetteten-2275.html) project at the Univeristy of Freiburg, Germany.

In this project, we are designing a novel solution to predict landing sites for a drone performing rescue operations in a disaster- affected zone. Our approach uses convolutional neural networks to perform pixel- wise segmentation of the monocular camera input from the drone into landable and non-landable sites. We train our model using a synthetic dataset created by us using Microsoft's drone simulator [*AirSim*](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim).
