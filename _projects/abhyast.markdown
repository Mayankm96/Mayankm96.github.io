We are building an aerial and ground vehicle team of autonomus robots that shall perform the operation of bomb- disposal squad. The system leverages the capabilities of the the two robotics to help overcome their limitations and perform the task efficiently.

My work focussed on the system integration and perception part of the ground robot. Using a two- wheeled differential drive robot designed by the team, we compared various SLAM algorithms such as GMapping, Hector-SLAM and RGBD-SLAM on it. I implemented the real-time object detection model YOLO9000 to detect suspect objects like bags, trash cans, and bottles, and used ROS to show the location of these objects on a 2D map created by the robot during its exploration.
