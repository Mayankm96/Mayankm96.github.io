AUVs are unoccupied submersibles without tethers which are powered using on- board batteries, fuel cells, or other energy resources. They are intended to carry out programmed missions with little or no direct human intervention, and may communicate with operators intermittently using acoustic links, satellite communication (SATCOM) systems.

As a student- initiated project at IIT Kanpur, the project aims to build marine systems to serve as a platform for research in underwater robotics at the institute and create affliations with industries looking for marine technology solutions. As one of the founding members of the team, I have had the opportunity to work in various domains of the project.

We participated with our first vehicle, *Varun*, at the National Student Autonomous Vehicle (SAVe) Competition in December 2016, and achieved the runners-up position on our debut.
