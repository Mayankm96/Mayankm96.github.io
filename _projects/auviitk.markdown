Initiated in 2014 by undergraduates, we aim to build an AUV as a platform for research in underwater robotics. The team has been divided into three sub-systems namely the mechanical, electrical and software subsystems, of which my major contributions has been towards the former two.

We participated at the National Student Autonomous Vehicle (SAVe) Competition held at Chennai in December 2016, and achieved a second position on our debut.
