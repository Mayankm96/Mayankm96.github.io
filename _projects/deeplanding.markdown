In this project, we designed a novel solution to predict landing sites for a drone perforing rescue operations in a disaster- affected zone. Our approach uses convolutional neural networks to perform pixel- wise segmentation of the input from the drone's camera into landable and non-landable sites. We trained our model using a synthetic dataset created by us on Unreal Engine, using Microsoft's drone simulator *AirSim*.
