Mentor: [Prof. B. V. Rathish Kumar](http://iitk.ac.in/new/rathish-kumar-b-v)


The motivation of the project lied in understanding the math behind Electrical Impedence Tomography (EIT), a medical imaging technique in which electrical conductivity across a part/tissue of the body is used to reconstruct a cross- section image of that part.

My work required reviewing the two popular Finite Element Analysis (FEA) methods- Ritz and Glarenkin, and to solve boundary value problems in electromagnetism  in two- dimensions using adaptive mesh techniques. For instance, the image to the left is a simulation done using the tool FreeFEM++ to solve a two- dimensional axisymmetric problem in electromagnetism.
