The project aimed to design a novel solution to predict landing sites for a drone flying in a disaster- affected zone. Using Convolutional Neural Networks, our approach segments a single camera input from the drone into landable and non-landable sites. We trained our model using a synthetic dataset created by us on Unreal Engine, using Microsoft's drone simulator *AirSim*.
