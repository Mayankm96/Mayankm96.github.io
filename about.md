<h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
<br>
I am Mayank Mittal, a junior in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK), India. Although a self- proclaimed _jack of all trades_, I owe severable cherishable experiences to this. 

A lot of my work, as an undergraduate, have been self- initiated at the [Robotics Club](http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/) of our institute. The most significant of all is the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) which my friends and I started working on in our freshman year. Last summers, I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Farshad Khorrmai](http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/farshad-khorrami) at New York University (NYU) on implementation of SLAM algorithms for marine robotics. My experience strengthened my interest to work in the field of robotics.
 
Apart from academia, I tend to spend my time playing tennis, running tracks or trying out random melodies on my guitar. For a fact, I enjoy making presentations and reports, and end up spending hours to simply ensure everything is the way I pictured it in my head.

Currently, I am interested in working on motion planning problems, particularly on path planning for mobile robots and grasp planning.
