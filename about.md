I am Mayank, a junior in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK), India. Although a self- proclaimed _jack of all trades_, I owe severable cherishable experiences to this. A lot of work that I have done as an undergraduate have been self- initiated which eventually gained recognition to gain funding from the institute. Over the years, I have ended up exploring several fields, a few of which I currently persue, while the remaining share a little corner on my workshelf (and sometimes even my [resume]("{{ site.documents.resume | prepend: site.baseurl }}")).

The roots to my interest in robotics trace back to my childhood when it was merely a hobby. However its possibilities and importance to our future motivates me to dig deeper into the subject. Last summers, I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Farshad Khorrmai](http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/farshad-khorrami) from New York University on implementation of SLAM algorithms for underwater robotics.

Currently, I am interested in working on motion planning problems, particularly on path pllanning for mobile robots and grasp planning.
