<h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
<br>
I am Mayank Mittal, a senior in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK)](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), India. Although a self-proclaimed _jack of all trades_, it has been a savior for me during most of my undertakings. (Probably that's the reason why I love robotics at the first place, you need a degree of interdisciplinary knowledge to work in it!)

A lot of my work, as an undergraduate, have been self-initiated at the [Robotics Club](http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/) of our institute. The most significant of all is the [Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)](auviitk.com), which my friends and I started working on in our freshman year. In 2016, I was awarded the prestigious Boeing Robotics Scholarship and spent around six months working in The Boeing Company's University Relations program at IITK called [Abhyast](https://www.iitk.ac.in/dord/boeing/public/). 

Last summer, I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Burgard](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~burgard/) and [Mr. Abhinav Valada](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~valada/). at the Autonomous Intelligent Systems Lab at the University of Freiburg, Germany, on using deep learning to predict landing sites from aerial images. My experience strengthened my interest to work in the field of robotics, and I am now planning to pursue higher studies in robot perception and manipulation.

Apart from academia, I tend to spend my time playing lawn tennis, running tracks or reading autobiographies. For a fact, I enjoy making reports and giving presentations. Often I end up spending hours to simply ensure everything is the way I picture it in my head, which although makes the entire process slow and frustrating, it is still worth the efforts.

I enjoy discussing new ideas and getting my hands dirty with projects, so in case you would like to reach out to me, feel free to e-mail me at <mailto: mayankm@iitk.ac.in>.
