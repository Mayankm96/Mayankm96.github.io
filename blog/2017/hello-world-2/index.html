  <article class="post-content">
    <p>It has been a while since I have thought of writing a blog. The motivation first came when my friends and I were thinking of starting a blog for a <a href="http://auviitk.com">project</a> to keep track of our progress. My friend <a href="http://shikherverma.com">Shikher</a>, a great developer himself, helped me with the initial push that I desperately needed to start things off by introducing me to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and how easy it made writing blog posts.</p>

<p>Robotics, an interdisciplinary field as many may know, requires knowledge from a variety of majors such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer sciences, material sciences and aerospace engineering. This persuaded me to take several electives from other departments during my undergrad, providing me a flavor of the kind of research prospects the field holds.</p>

<p>When I first started with “robotics”, I was in high school and was using the kit called <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms">Lego Mindstorm NXT 1.0</a>. At that time, building and programming a robot seemed like an intuitive and creative task to me all thanks to the way the Lego kit is organized. However, as I started looking into robotics from an engineer’s perspective, the intuition began being backed up with concrete math and physics. This very connection between intuition and knowledge is what made me want to pursue a career in the STEM, and my childhood hobby transitioned into a career option in college.</p>

<p>Now as the semesters pass by in college, each abstracted layer in that Lego kit is being stripped down to its fundamentals, bringing in new and methodical ideas to design real-world systems. It would be a lie to say that the journey hasn’t had its up and downs but every time I think about it, it only makes me want to work harder and try out newer things.</p>

<p>Since I usually stay occupied with my projects and academics, I hope to blog semi-regularly. A few of these blogs might be blatant venting or sharing of my experiences in robotics, but I hope that you all may find them resourceful and informative and would enjoy reading them!</p>
