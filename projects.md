Initiated in 2014 by a team of undergraduates, as a project in Robotics Club, we aim to build an AUV as a platform for research in underwater robotics. The team has been divided into three sub-systems namely the mechanical, electrical and software subsystems, of which my major contributions has been towards the former two.

We participated at the National Student Autonomous Vehicle (SAVe) Competition held at Chennai in December 2016, and achieved a second position on our debut, among 12 other shortlisted teams for the finals.

## Unmanned Exploration System

<p style="text-align:left;"> Funded by The Boeing Company <span style="float:right;"><small>July 2016- ongoing</small></span></p>

In our current phase of the project (phase-VII), we are building an aerial and ground vehicle team of autonomus robots that shall perform the operation of bomb- disposal squad. The two robots seem to form a 'symbiotic' relationship in which they help overcome each others limitations and leverage their capabilities.

In order to increae our efficiency, the team of seven members has been divided into two- one dealing with mapping using the aerial robot while the other one working on the localization and planning for the ground robot. My work has been directed towards using sampling based algorithms such as Rapidly- exploring Random Trees (RRT) and its variants (RRT* , A* -RRT*) for planning the motion of the ground robot, and implemnting it on the same.

## Implementation of SLAM for Underwater Robotics

The project involved reviewing various Bayesian filters and Least Squares optimization for Simulataneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), keeping in mind its applicability to underwater robots. 

Towards the end of the project, I implmented the Extended Kalman Filter algorithm on a Pioneer 3dx robot using the robot simulator V-REP and MATLAB, in order to deepen my understanding of the various elements involved in the SLAM problem such as data association, and scan alignment.

## Finite Element Analysis in Electromagnetism

The motivation of the project lied in understanding the math behind Electrical Impedence Tomography (EIT), a medical imaging technique in which electrical conductivity across a part/tissue of the body is used to reconstruct a cross- section image of that part.

My work required reviewing the two popular Finite Element Analysis (FEA) methods- Ritz and Glarenkin, and to solve boundary value problems in electromagnetism  in two- dimensions using adaptive mesh techniques. For instance, the image to the left is a simulation done using the tool FreeFEM++ to solve a two- dimensional axisymmetric problem in electromagnetism.
