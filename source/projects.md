# Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) 
Funded by Dean of Research and Development, IIT Kanpur | <small> Status: Ongoing (November 2014- )</small>
 
_Supervisors_: [Prof. K. S. Venkatesh](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/), [Prof. Sachin Y. Shinde](http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/sachin-y-shinde)

Initiated in 2014 by a group of undergraduates, the project aims to build an AUV which would eventually serve as a platform for research in underwater robotics. The team has been divided into three sub-systems namely mechanical, electrical and software, of which my major contributions has been towards the mechanical and electrical aspects till now.

We represented our institute at the National Student Autonomous Vehicle (SAVe) Competition held at Chennai in December 2016, and achieved the second position among 13 shortlisted teams for the finals.

# Unmanned Exploration System
Funded by The Boeing Company | <small>Status: Completed (July - January 2016)</small>

_Supervisors_: [Prof. Shantanu Bhattacharya](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~bhattacs/), [Prof. S. Kamle](http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/dr-s-kamle)

The project was initiated in 2009 to promote undergraduate research at the institute. The phase-VII of the project began on July 2016.The aim of current phase is to build an aerial and ground vehicle team which shall explore an unknown territory using SLAM algorithms.

# Implementation of SLAM for Underwater Robotics
Status: Completed (May-June 2016)

_Mentor_: [Prof. Farshad Khorrami](http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/farshad-khorrami)

The project involved reviewing the various Bayesian filters and Least Squares optimization for Simulataneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), keeping in mind its applicability to underwater robots.

The robot simulation tool V-REP was used to run available Kalman Filter algorithms for SLAM in a simple static environment in order to deepen the understanding of the entire problem.

# Finite Element Analysis in Electromagnetism

_Mentor_: [Prof. B. V. Rathish Kumar](http://iitk.ac.in/new/rathish-kumar-b-v)

The motivation of the project lied in understanding the math behind Electrical Impedence Tomography (EIT).

It required reviewing of the Ritz and Glarenkin's methods to solve differential equations in one- and two- dimensions, and implmenting them to solve boundary valued problems of electromagnetism using MATLAB and FreeFEM++.
